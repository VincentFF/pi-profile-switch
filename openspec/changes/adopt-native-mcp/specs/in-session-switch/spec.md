# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: In-session switching

`/profile use <name>` SHALL execute in order: wait for the current agent turn to finish, snapshot the runtime files, re-resolve the target profile through the full launch path, rewrite the runtime files in place, and trigger Pi's native reload.

Waiting SHALL use Pi's native idle wait and MUST NOT interrupt an in-flight turn.

Re-resolution SHALL include the same validation as the launch path: trust determination, catalog read, resource discovery, model and MCP validation. When resolution fails, NO runtime file SHALL be written and the runtime stays in its pre-switch state.

Switching SHALL NOT restart the Pi process; the current session's sessionId and message history SHALL remain unchanged.

Switching SHALL NOT change Pi's project-trust input: the instance's `trust.json` link form is identical before and after a switch, so project-level resource visibility stays stable within one process. Post-switch project-level visibility SHALL match launching directly with the target profile and MUST NOT require a process restart to take effect.

`/profile use` SHALL persist the selection and SHALL discard the pre-switch profile's overlay.

`/profile reload` SHALL follow the same path, but SHALL NOT produce a change summary and SHALL preserve the current profile's existing selection persistence (a one-shot selection made at launch remains one-shot after reload).

An explicit empty `mcps` selection SHALL have the same effect after `/profile use` and `/profile reload` as at launch: the rewritten instance configuration disables every user-level server in the merged snapshot. Switching to a profile that omits `mcps` SHALL restore the merged snapshot's full user-level server availability.

#### Scenario: Successful switch

- **WHEN** `/profile use implement` is executed and both resolution and reload succeed
- **THEN** the runtime files are rewritten with that profile's resolution result and the session is not interrupted

#### Scenario: Project-level visibility unchanged by switching

- **WHEN** the project is trusted, started with a named profile, and `/profile use default` is executed
- **THEN** project-level skills and extensions are visible under both profiles, the process is not restarted, and sessionId and message history are unchanged

#### Scenario: Failure at resolution stage

- **WHEN** the target profile's references cannot resolve
- **THEN** the operation fails reporting the cause, and no runtime file is modified

#### Scenario: Reload preserves one-shot selection

- **WHEN** launched as `pi-profile review` (one-shot selection), followed by `/profile reload`
- **THEN** `review` is still running and the selection is not thereby written into runtime state

#### Scenario: Switching to an empty MCP selection

- **WHEN** a session switches from a profile that omits `mcps` to a named profile declaring `mcps: []`
- **THEN** the user-level servers from the merged snapshot are unavailable without restarting the Pi session

#### Scenario: Empty MCP selection survives reload

- **WHEN** a named profile with `mcps: []` executes `/profile reload`
- **THEN** the user-level servers from the merged snapshot remain unavailable

#### Scenario: Switching back to omitted MCP selection

- **WHEN** a session switches from a named profile with `mcps: []` to a profile omitting `mcps`
- **THEN** user-level servers return to their merged-snapshot availability

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Plan application and change summary at session start

**Reason**: Two clauses encode adapter mechanisms that no longer exist: "Literal adapter selectors … SHALL retain the adapter's restrictive matching" and the scenario "Loose adapter file does not own sibling extension tools", whose ownership test is built around the adapter being a loose extension file.

**Migration**: No user action: tool ownership becomes tools registered by Pi's built-in MCP extension. The replacement contract is the ADDED requirement "Session-start plan application and change summary".

### Requirement: MCP tool policy observability and switch rollback

**Reason**: The disabled-server clause and one scenario title refer to "the effective adapter configuration", which no longer exists; the disabled mark now comes from `enabled: false` in the merged user-level configuration.

**Migration**: No user action. The replacement contract is the ADDED requirement "MCP tool policy status and switch rollback".

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Session-start plan application and change summary

Every session start (launch, reload, new, resume, fork) SHALL apply the plan in the current runtime directory. When `tools` is declared, the active tool set SHALL combine its original references expanded against Pi's live non-MCP registry with the MCP-owned tools available under the server and per-server tool selections. When `tools` is absent, Pi's current non-MCP tool availability SHALL stay unchanged; overlay disabled tool entries still narrow their established base. An absent or empty `mcp_tools` object MUST NOT by itself change Pi's tool state.

When the plan carries disabled tool entries from the overlay, the active tool set SHALL subtract their matches at that moment. The base for overlay resolution SHALL remain the profile's resolved Pi tool references when `tools` is declared, or the runtime's available tool set when it is not; per-server MCP tool filtering SHALL be governed by `mcp_tools` and server selection.

Pi tool literals with zero matches against the applicable live registry SHALL be reported as warnings and MUST NOT be silently dropped. Literal selectors in `mcp_tools` SHALL remain restrictive without a missing-name diagnostic, as specified in "Per-server MCP tool selection" in the resource-reference specification.

When the plan marks the selection for persistence and this session start was triggered by a reload, the active profile SHALL be written to the state file of that profile's source scope.

The change summary produced by a switch SHALL be injected into the next agent turn and SHALL appear exactly once: the mark is cleared after injection and later reloads do not repeat it.

#### Scenario: Tools whitelist re-applied after reload

- **WHEN** the new extension instance executes session start after reload
- **THEN** the active non-MCP tool set is reset to the original references expanded against the live registry, while available MCP-owned tools remain independent of those references

#### Scenario: Built-in MCP extension does not own sibling extension tools

- **WHEN** a profile declares `tools: []`, MCP servers provide tools through Pi's built-in MCP extension, and an unrelated extension registers a tool
- **THEN** the unrelated extension's tool is not active after session start or reload, while MCP tools permitted by MCP policy remain available

#### Scenario: Disabled tools stay disabled across reload

- **WHEN** the overlay has disabled a tool and a reload occurs
- **THEN** the tool is absent from the active tool set after session start re-applies the plan

#### Scenario: Change summary appears exactly once

- **WHEN** `/profile reload` is executed after a successful switch
- **THEN** only the first turn after the switch receives the change summary

#### Scenario: State write does not overwrite the overlay

- **WHEN** the post-reload instance writes the active profile per the plan
- **THEN** an overlay already in the state file remains unchanged, unless this switch explicitly requested discarding it

#### Scenario: Profile switch changes per-server MCP tool policy

- **WHEN** `/profile use review` switches from a profile allowing all `github` tools to one listing only `search`
- **THEN** the existing Pi session retains its identity and history, and `github` tools other than `search` are no longer callable, including via indirect MCP calls

#### Scenario: Empty MCP list survives reload

- **WHEN** a profile with `mcp_tools: { "github": [] }` reloads
- **THEN** the server remains enabled and no `github` tool becomes callable after the reload

### Requirement: MCP tool policy status and switch rollback

`/profile status` SHALL show which enabled servers have unrestricted, explicitly restricted, or no MCP tools, including the declared selectors for explicitly restricted servers; it SHALL NOT report selector validity or missing-name candidates. When `mcps` is undeclared, a server the merged user-level configuration marks `enabled: false` SHALL appear as discovered but not enabled, rather than enabled. A switch or reload failure while applying a per-server restriction SHALL restore the previous MCP and Pi tool availability, not leave a partial policy.

#### Scenario: Status distinguishes absent and empty lists

- **WHEN** an active profile omits `github` from `mcp_tools` and explicitly sets `linear` to `[]`
- **THEN** `/profile status` reports `github` as unrestricted and `linear` as having no enabled MCP tools

#### Scenario: Status respects merged-config-disabled servers without an MCP whitelist

- **WHEN** `mcps` is undeclared and the merged user-level configuration marks `linear` with `enabled: false` while `github` is enabled
- **THEN** `/profile status` reports `github` as enabled and `linear` as discovered but not enabled, without listing `linear` as an unrestricted enabled server

#### Scenario: Failed switch restores previous tool policy

- **WHEN** a profile switch fails during reload after writing a different per-server tool policy
- **THEN** the prior runtime files and tool availability are restored, and the cause is reported
