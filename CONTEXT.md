# pi-profile-switch

`pi-profile-switch` is a Pi package that treats profiles as Pi's resource-selection mechanism: a profile references existing skills, extensions, configured MCP servers, and tools, and switches those references within a single running Pi instance.

## Language

**Profile**:
A named workflow definition that references resources and optionally declares model, thinking level, and instructions. Lives in the global or project catalog.
_Avoid_: preset, config

**default profile**:
The built-in, undeletable profile that loads Pi's full set of discoverable resources. Treated as global-sourced for state writes.

**Catalog**:
A `profiles.json` file holding profile definitions: `~/.pi-profile-switch/profiles.json` (global; legacy fallback reads `~/.pi/agent/profiles.json`) or `.pi/profiles.json` (project). A project profile with the same name fully replaces the global one; there is no inheritance.

**Source scope**:
Whether a profile came from the global or project catalog. Determines where runtime state and CRUD edits are written.

**RuntimeOverlay**:
A temporary adjustment to the active profile's resource and tool selections, usually called just "overlay". Never written to a catalog; `/profile reset` discards it.
_Avoid_: session profile, temporary profile

**Runtime state**:
The persisted active profile selection and overlay, written to the state file of the profile's source scope.

**ActivationPlan**:
The immutable, fully resolved set of skills, extensions, MCP servers, tools, and instructions produced from one profile plus one overlay. It is materialized as generated settings (launch) or a settings rewrite plus native reload (in-session switch).

**Generated settings**:
The pi-profile-switch-owned runtime directory under `~/.pi-profile-switch/instances/<profile>/agent`, holding a generated `settings.json` (the profile's resource selection encoded for Pi's native settings mechanism) and full-fidelity symlinks into the user's real `~/.pi/agent` (`auth.json`, `models.json`, `npm/`, sessions, etc.), pointed at via `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`. `trust.json` is linked only for the `default` profile — for named profiles the launcher is the sole project-trust gatekeeper. Never a user configuration file; regenerated on every launch, switch, or reload.

**Runtime reload**:
Pi's native `ctx.reload()`: re-reads the settings file from disk, rebuilds resources, re-executes extensions, and preserves the session. The mechanism behind `/profile use`, `/profile reload`, overlay application, and rollback.

**Resource**:
Any capability a profile references: skill, extension, MCP server, or tool.

**SkillRegistry**:
The mapping from skill name to final `SKILL.md`, mirroring Pi's current full discovery result. Re-resolved on every start or reload.

**ExtensionDiscovery**:
The discovery and selection view for extensions (ADR-0007): configured packages (`pi.extensions` entries, referenced by package name or source alias) and loose files in the standard extensions directories (`<agentDir>/extensions/*.{ts,js}` and trusted project `.pi/extensions/*.{ts,js}`), referenced by filename stem, glob, or absolute/home-relative path. Zero extra configuration files required; pure discover-and-filter.

**McpServerRegistry**:
The MCP server names and states discovered by `pi-mcp-adapter`. Owned by the adapter; pi-profile-switch only references server names.

**pi-mcp-adapter**:
The optional external Pi package that owns MCP server configuration, connections, and credentials. pi-profile-switch integrates with it but never stores MCP connection details in profiles.

**Project trust**:
Pi's trust decision for a project directory. pi-profile-switch never reads or writes untrusted project directories. Because generated settings set `defaultProjectTrust: "never"`, the resolver is the sole gatekeeper: it reads the real `trust.json` and admits project resources only when trusted.
