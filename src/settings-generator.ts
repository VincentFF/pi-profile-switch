/**
 * SettingsGenerator: materializes an ActivationPlan as a pi-profile-owned
 * runtime directory (ADR-0005).
 *
 * Two entry points:
 * - `generateRuntimeDir` (launcher): create a fresh per-launch runtime dir
 *   under the workspace instances root, write the files, mirror the real
 *   agent dir as symlinks (trust.json only for default), derive env.
 * - `writeRuntimeFiles` (in-session switch, ticket 05): rewrite
 *   settings.json + pi-profile.json inside the EXISTING runtime dir (the
 *   running process's PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR cannot move), and transition the
 *   trust.json link to match the new plan's filter mode.
 *
 * For the built-in `default` profile the generated settings preserve the
 * user's global settings untouched and re-include the real agent dir's
 * resource dirs (their discovery root moves with `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`), so
 * the spawned pi behaves exactly like native `pi`.
 *
 * For named profiles the generated settings encode the profile's selection
 * over user-scope resources only (see docs/architecture/overview.md):
 * - agentDir-scope resources: additive allowlist paths (the discovery root
 *   moved, so nothing auto-discovered from the real agent dir)
 * - `~/.agents` skills: always auto-discovered, so unselected ones are
 *   force-excluded with `-<path>` entries
 * - packages: user-configured package entries rewritten to object form with
 *   per-type allowlists (unmanaged types keep the user's key or Pi's default)
 * - project-scope resources (project `.pi/skills`, project `.pi/extensions`,
 *   ancestor `.agents/skills`) are never encoded: Pi discovers them natively
 *   whenever the project is trusted, and the profile neither adds nor
 *   excludes them
 * - `defaultProjectTrust: "never"` only suppresses Pi's interactive trust
 *   prompt (a stored decision in the real trust.json still applies); the
 *   project's `.pi/settings.json` is not merged here — Pi reads it natively
 * - unmanaged kinds (prompts, themes) pass through: the user's arrays are
 *   preserved and the real agent dir's prompts/themes dirs re-included
 * - tools/model are written to generated settings (defaultTools,
 *   defaultProvider, defaultModel, defaultThinkingLevel); the launch plan
 *   file feeds the in-pi extension (tools strict allowlist, status)
 *
 * User configuration files are never modified.
