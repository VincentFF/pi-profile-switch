/**
 * Project trust resolution for the launcher — pi-profile is the sole
 * gatekeeper for project resources, because generated settings carry
 * `defaultProjectTrust: "never"` and Pi therefore never auto-discovers them.
 *
 * Mirrors Pi's own trust decision order (`resolveProjectTrusted`), with
 * pi-profile's catalog/state files added to the trust-requiring
 * resource set (they are pi-profile's project attack surface; Pi doesn't
 * know about them):
 *   1. one-run `--approve` / `--no-approve` override (consumed by the
 *      launcher, never forwarded for named profiles)
 *   2. a project with no trust-requiring resources at all is trusted —
 *      there is nothing project-scoped to gate
 *   3. the stored decision in the real `trust.json` (nearest ancestor wins)
 *   4. the user's `defaultProjectTrust` setting — but only "always" grants;
 *      "ask" cannot prompt here (the launcher has no trust UI), so it falls
 *      through to untrusted
 *   5. otherwise untrusted: project catalogs, registries, resources, and
 *      state files are not read at all
 *
 * Known divergence from Pi: extension `project_trust` event handlers are not
 * consulted — that would require executing extension code in the launcher,
 * which pi-profile never does. In named-profile sessions the event is moot
 * anyway (generated settings carry `defaultProjectTrust: "never"`).
