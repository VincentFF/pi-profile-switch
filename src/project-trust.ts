/**
 * Project trust resolution for the launcher — pi-profile's gate for the
 * project-scope content it reads itself: the project catalog, the project
 * runtime state, and the project MCP config. Project-level resources
 * (skills, extensions, prompts, themes, settings) are Pi's own business: its
 * trust store decision, exposed through the linked `trust.json`, decides
 * their visibility (see ADR-0011).
 *
 * Mirrors Pi's own trust decision order (`resolveProjectTrusted`), with
 * pi-profile's catalog/state files added to the trust-requiring
 * resource set (they are pi-profile's project attack surface; Pi doesn't
 * know about them):
 *   1. one-run `--approve` / `--no-approve` override (consumed by the
 *      launcher and re-applied to the spawned pi for every profile)
 *   2. a project with no trust-requiring resources at all is trusted —
 *      there is nothing project-scoped to gate
 *   3. the stored decision in the real `trust.json` (nearest ancestor wins)
 *   4. the user's `defaultProjectTrust` setting — but only "always" grants;
 *      "ask" cannot prompt here (the launcher has no trust UI), so it falls
 *      through to untrusted
 *   5. otherwise untrusted: project catalogs, project state, and project MCP
 *      config are not read at all
 *
 * Known divergence from Pi: extension `project_trust` event handlers are not
 * consulted — that would require executing extension code in the launcher,
 * which pi-profile never does. A spawned Pi still runs those handlers with
 * its own settings, so an extension that answers yes/no can decide the
 * project scope of that session.
